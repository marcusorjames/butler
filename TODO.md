- Write scripts to automatically add sites
- use that thing that automatically creates hostfile entries
- add ability to use in project docker compose as well
- Add --site to docker-compose exec passthrough
- Remove extra scripts checks from docker-compose passthrough which is only relavent to "up"
- Add custom commands to Sites/ e.g. "butler artisan" which can be aliased to butler run php /app/artisan
